Revision history for Perl module Business::xISBN

1.001_01 2016-08-06T09:38:11Z
	* Move xISBN stuff from Business::ISBN into its own module. The
	xISBN stuff is past its declared end of life, so this allows us
	to update Business::ISBN to remove xisbn but still allow people
	to use xISBN until it actually disappears.
